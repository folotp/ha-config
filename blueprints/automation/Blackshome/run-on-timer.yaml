  description: "# ⏳ Entity - Run ON Timer\n**Version: 1.6**\n\nLet us know what you
    think of this blueprint and for community support including updates: [Click Here](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/entity-run-on-timer/499217)\n\n**The
    Automation Process:**\n  - If selecting \"Trigger entity state ON\", when the
    entity is turned ON, it will be automatically turned OFF after the pre-set time
    period.\n  - If selecting \"Trigger entity state OFF\", when the entity is turned
    OFF, it will be automatically turned ON after the pre-set time period.\n  - You
    have a \"Trigger Entity Sync\" option. When using multiple entities and one entity
    changes state i.e. manually turned ON or OFF, then all the entities will be turned
    ON or OFF automatically in sync together.\n  - You have the option to use a timer
    helper. This is useful if you would like to display the remaining time in a dashboard
    and the timer will survive a HA restart.\n  - HA Restart - If you use a timer
    helper it will resume as nothing happened (recommended). If you don't use a timer
    helper, then when HA restarts, the automation will try and reset back to the start.\n\n\nRequired
