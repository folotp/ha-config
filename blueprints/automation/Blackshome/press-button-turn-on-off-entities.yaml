    Automation Process:**\n  - When you press the button it will turn ON the main
    entity input.\n  - When you press the button again it will turn OFF the main entity
    input.\n  - You have the option to input an alternating entity that will be the
    opposite state to the main entity.\n\n**NOTE** - The button must have no state,
    like a button helper.\n\nRequired = *\n\nNeed help? See our FAQ: [Click Here](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/press-button-turn-on-off-entities/634488/2?u=blacky)\n\n**If
